*******************************************************************************

        This catalog contains basic parameters on distances, velocities,
metallicities, luminosities, colors, and dynamical parameters
for 157 objects classified as globular clusters in the Milky Way galaxy.

The data are presented in three parts, with quantities as defined below.
A complete list of source references and an explanation of the quantities,
along with their calibration information, is given in the companion
"Bibliography" file accessible through the WorldWideWeb from either of
the following links:

        Please acknowledge the use of this catalog in any published work
you derive from it.  The proper citation is the original paper

        Harris, W.E. 1996, AJ, 112, 1487

which briefly describes the setup of the catalog.  When you cite it in your
text, please use "Harris 1996 (2010 edition)".
        I would also greatly appreciate receiving any new information,
in published or preprint form, which would help me keep the list up to date.
Please also tell me about published data that I may have missed.  Thanks!

THIS CATALOG IS IN THREE SECTIONS:

        PART I:    Cluster identifications and positions
        PART II:   Metallicities, Integrated magnitudes, colors, 
        PART III:  Radial velocities, velocity dispersions, structural parameters

___________________________________________________________________________

Part I:  Identifications and Positional Data

Key to columns:
(1) Cluster identification number
(2) Other commonly used cluster name
(3,4) Right ascension and declination (epoch J2000)
(5,6) Galactic longitude and latitude (degrees)
(7) Distance from Sun (kiloparsecs)
(8) Distance from Galactic center (kpc), assuming R_0=8.0 kpc
(9-11) Galactic distance components X,Y,Z in kiloparsecs, in a
    Sun-centered coordinate system; X points toward Galactic center, 
    Y in direction of Galactic rotation, Z toward North Galactic Pole

Part II:  Metallicity and Photometry

Key to columns:
(1) Cluster identification
(2) Metallicity [Fe/H]
(3) Weight of mean metallicity; essentially the number of independent [Fe/H]
	measurements averaged together.  See bibliography for full description
(4) Foreground reddening
(5) V magnitude level of the horizontal branch (or RR Lyraes)
(6) Apparent visual distance modulus
(7) Integrated V magnitude of the cluster
(8) Absolute visual magnitude (cluster luminosity),  M_V,t = V_t - (m-M)V
(9-12) Integrated color indices (uncorrected for reddening)
(13) Spectral type of the integrated cluster light
(14) Projected ellipticity of isophotes, e = 1-(b/a)

Part III:  Velocities and Structural Parameters

Key to columns:
(1) Cluster identification
(2) Heliocentric radial velocity (km/s)
(3) Observational (internal) uncertainty in radial velocity
(4) Radial velocity relative to Solar neighborhood LSR
(5) Central velocity dispersion sig_v (km/s)
(6) Observational (internal) uncertainty in velocity dispersion
(7) King-model central concentration, c = log(r_t/r_c); a 'c' denotes a core-collapsed cluster
(8) Core radius in arcmin
(9) Half-light radius in arcmin
(10) Central surface brightness, V magnitudes per square arcsecond
(11) Central luminosity density, log_10(Solar luminosities per cubic parsec)
(12) Core relaxation time t(r_c), in log_10(years)
(13) Median relaxation time t(r_h), in log_10(years)
